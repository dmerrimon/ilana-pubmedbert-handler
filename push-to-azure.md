# GET FILES TO AZURE - RIGHT NOW

## The Issue:
Azure Static Web App was created but files aren't deployed yet. You need to push files to the GitHub repo that Azure is watching.

## SOLUTION - 3 Steps:

### Step 1: Check GitHub Repo
Your Azure app is connected to a GitHub repo. Go to your Azure portal and check which repo it's watching.

### Step 2: Push Files to That Repo
```bash
# Navigate to your files
cd "/Users/donmerriman/Ilana Labs/ilana-core/office-addin"

# If repo doesn't exist, create it:
git init
git add taskpane.html taskpane.js *.css
git commit -m "Deploy Protocol Intelligence to Azure"

# Add your GitHub repo (replace with your actual repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Azure Auto-Deploys
Once you push to GitHub, Azure will automatically:
- Detect the changes
- Run GitHub Actions
- Deploy your files
- Make them live at your Azure URL

## OR - Quick Alternative:

### Upload via Azure Portal:
1. Go to your Azure Static Web App
2. Click "Browse" or "Functions and APIs" 
3. Look for upload/deployment options
4. Upload your files directly

## Files to Deploy:
- ✅ taskpane.html
- ✅ taskpane.js  
- ✅ grammarly-style.css
- ✅ feasibility-styles.css
- ✅ knowledge-styles.css
- ✅ design-optimization-styles.css

**Once files are deployed, your URL will work and you can test the manifest!**
