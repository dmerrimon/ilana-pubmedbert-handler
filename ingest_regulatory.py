2. PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE: Studies must follow the approved protocol. Any deviations must be documented and reported to regulatory authorities.

3. DATA INTEGRITY: All data must be accurate, complete, and verifiable. Source documents must support all data entries.

4. SAFETY MONITORING: Serious adverse events must be reported within 24 hours. Safety reviews must be conducted regularly.

5. INVESTIGATOR QUALIFICATIONS: Principal investigators must be qualified by education, training, and experience.

6. INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD: All studies must have IRB approval before initiation and continuing review during conduct.""",

3. ENDPOINT VALIDATION: Endpoints should be validated for the intended population and indication.
