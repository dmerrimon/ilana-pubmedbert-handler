Individuals who suffer from Major Depressive Disorder would be considered a vulnerable population and therefore included within this clinical investigation.    These vulnerable subjects according to the ISO 14155 definition will be asked to provide their informed consent if they are capable of providing it themselves and the consent process will be performed without undue delay. Informed consent processes shall be conducted according to national law and IRB procedures.  The protection of the rights and welfare of study participants will be overseen by the responsible IRB and the Principal Investigator.  17 SUSPENSION OR PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION  17.1 CRITERIA FOR SUSPENSION OR PREMATURE TERMINATION  The clinical study may be stopped at any time at the Sponsor\u2019s discretion.  In addition, further recruitment in the study may be stopped due to insufficient compliance with the protocol, GCP-related issues, and/or other applicable  regulatory requirements, procedure-related problems, lack of enrollment, or if the number of subject discontinuations for administrative reasons is deemed too high.",
